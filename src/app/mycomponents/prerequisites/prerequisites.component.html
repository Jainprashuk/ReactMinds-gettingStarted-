    What You Need to Know Before Diving into React
</h1>
<br>
<p>Before diving into React development, it's important to have a good foundation in several key technologies and concepts. Here are the prerequisites and recommended knowledge areas that will help you make the most of your React learning journey:</p>
<p>
    <li>HTML and CSS: A strong understanding of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is fundamental. These are the building blocks of web development, and React is primarily concerned with the user interface layer.

        </li>

        <li>JavaScript: React is a JavaScript library, so a good grasp of JavaScript is essential. You should be comfortable with concepts like variables, data types, functions, and objects. Understanding modern JavaScript features, such as arrow functions, classes, and destructuring, is also beneficial. <br> ~ You Can Refer <a href="https://js-minds.vercel.app/">https://js-minds.vercel.app/</a> For Javascript</li>
