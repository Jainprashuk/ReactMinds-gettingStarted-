<h1 class="text-center">React has taken the frontend web development world by storm. Why?</h1>
<br><br>
<h4>~ Less complex than the other alternatives</h4>
<p>At the time when React was announced, Ember.js and Angular 1.x were the predominant choices as a framework. Both these imposed so many conventions on the code that porting an existing app was not convenient at all.

    React made a choice to be very easy to integrate into an existing project, because thatâ€™s how they had to do it at Facebook in order to introduce it to the existing codebase. Also, those 2 frameworks brought too much to the table, while React only chose to implement the View layer instead of the full MVC stack.</p>


<h4>~ Perfect timing</h4>
<p>
    At the time, Angular 2.x was announced by Google, along with the backwards incompatibility and major changes it was going to bring. Moving from Angular 1 to 2 was like moving to a different framework, so this, along with execution speed improvements that React promised, made it something developers were eager to try.
</p>


<h4>~ Backed by Facebook</h4>
<p>
    Being backed by Facebook is, of course, going to benefit a project if it turns out to be successful.

Facebook currently has a strong interest in React, sees the value of it being Open Source, and this is a huge plus for all the developers using it in their own projects.
